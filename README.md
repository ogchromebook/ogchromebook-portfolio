# OGChromebook-Portfolio

## Description

This is a starter portfolio made with HTML and CSS. This project is used to highlight skills I have learned through the first few weeks of the course. This portfolio also provides a breif section about myself, the projects I am working on, and some contact information.

I learned a ton regarding CSS rules regarding layout and placement of elements on a webpage. I cannot wait to look back at this project fondly to see how far I have come as a developer.
